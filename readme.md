# HTML Table Fundamentals

## HTML Table
So before learning about Tables, you should know what Table is not meant to be used for.  So Tables in the past when there was not flexbox and grid to build layouts, are used as building layouts of the page. But Tables are only intended to be used as to display data in rows and columns. And as there are now flexboxs and grids, they should be only be used for to represent data. 
So now you know  that you should always use it for structuring data not for laying out the page. So  Table in HTML is just structured easy to access structure where data is inserted into rows and columns. And you can easily read and understand data by just looking to associated Table headers in row or column  with tabular data in columns or rows.
